# Drone Control System
Lessons and code for autonomous navigation of a quadrotor

Build a software system to control and monitor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. This project can involve designing algorithms for autonomous flight, implementing real-time telemetry and control, and integrating features like obstacle avoidance or mission planning.

**My guide for building this project**

Learn the Basics:

Programming Languages: Start with a language commonly used in drone software development, such as Python or C++. Python is known for its simplicity and extensive libraries, while C++ offers better performance.
Basics of Drone Systems: Familiarize yourself with the different components of a drone system, including flight controllers, sensors, motors, and communication protocols like MAVLink.
Understand Drone Control Concepts:

Study drone control concepts, including manual control, autonomous flight, telemetry, and sensor integration.
Learn about PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controllers and their application in drone stabilization and control.
Set Up Development Environment:

Install necessary development tools such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
Set up a simulation environment for testing and development, such as Ardupilot SITL (Software-In-The-Loop) or the PX4 Simulator.
Explore Drone APIs and Frameworks:

Research popular drone APIs and frameworks like DroneKit, ROS (Robot Operating System), or PX4. These frameworks provide high-level abstractions and tools for drone software development.
Study the documentation and sample projects provided by these frameworks to understand their features and usage.
Implement Manual Control:

Begin by creating a basic interface to control the drone manually using a joystick, keyboard, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
Use the drone API or framework to send control commands for various flight parameters like throttle, pitch, roll, and yaw.
Develop Autonomous Flight Algorithms:

Start with simple autonomous flight tasks such as waypoint navigation or hovering.
Implement algorithms to control the drone's position and orientation based on GPS or other sensor inputs.
Consider incorporating more advanced techniques like path planning or SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for autonomous navigation.
Integrate Telemetry and Real-Time Data:

Implement telemetry functionality to receive real-time data from the drone, such as altitude, battery status, GPS coordinates, and sensor readings.
Visualize the telemetry data on a dashboard or GUI for monitoring and analysis.
Add Obstacle Avoidance:

Study obstacle detection and avoidance techniques such as computer vision, LiDAR, or sonar.
Integrate sensors or algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles during autonomous flight.
Implement Mission Planning:

Develop a mission planning module to define and execute complex flight missions with predefined waypoints, actions, and conditions.
Allow the user to define mission parameters and monitor mission progress.
Test and Refine:

Test your software in a simulated environment first, ensuring the drone responds correctly to manual and autonomous control.
Gradually transition to testing on actual drones, ensuring safety precautions and adhering to local regulations.
Iterate and refine your system based on feedback and testing results.
